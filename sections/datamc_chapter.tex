\subsection{Data} \label{sec:Data}

In both Run-2 HGam analyses discussed in this dissertation, we use the full LHC Run-2 dataset, consisting of $139.0 \plusminus 2.4 fb^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions with a center of mass energy $\sqrt{s} = 13 TeV$ recorded by the ATLAS detector between 2015 and 2018 \ref{Jennet106}. Figure XXX shows the instantaneous luminosity gathered by the detector as a function of time. 

The trigger used to select events is the diphoton trigger HLT_g35_loose_g25_loose (for 2015-2016 data) and HLT_g35_medium_g25_medium (for 2017-2018 data). Both triggers require two photon candidates, one with a transverse energy $E_{T}$ of at least 35 GeV and the other with transverse energy of at least 25 GeV. The 2015-2016 trigger requires two photons that pass the "loose" ID requirement, while the 2017-2018 trigger requires two photons that pass the "medium" ID requirement (the cut was tightened due to increased luminosity and pileup). The trigger was calibrated using radiative Z decays, and is observed to be greater than 95\% efficient when \ref:cite{Rachel58}

In addition to this, we require that all 


















\subsection{ttHCP Monte Carlo Samples} \label{sec:ttHCPMC} 

In the $ttH CP$ analysis, an Effective Field Theory (EFT) setting a cutoff scale of 1 TeV, below which no new BSM particles coupling to the Higgs exist, is used to generate Monte Carlo samples. The EFT used is the Higgs Characterization (HC) model \ref{cite: HC}, implemented in the  MadGraph5_aMC@NLO generator \ref{cite: Madgraph}. As previously mentioned, the top-Higgs interaction term of the Lagrangian in the presence of CP-violation can be parameterized as

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \kappa_{t} g_{t} \bar{t} (cos(\alpha)+ sin(\alpha) i \gamma^{5} )th
\end{equation}

where $g_{t} = \frac{-m_{t}}{v} = \frac{-173.26 GeV}{246 GeV} = -0.703$ , $\kappa_{t}$ is the dimensionless coupling-strength term ($\kappa_{t}= 1$ in the Standard Model), and $\alpha$ is an angle that parameterizes the CP-mixing strength ($\alpha = 0$ in the Standard Model, $\alpha = \frac{\pi}{2}$ in the fully CP-odd case). The treatment of the $H \rightarrow \gamma \gamma$ and $ggH$ dependence on $\alpha$ is handled in several different ways, as discussed in \ref{sec:ttHCPresults}.

For all Monte Carlo samples, the renormalization ($μ_{R}$) and factorization ($μ_{F}$) scales are defined as the scalar sum of the transverse masses of all final-state particles divided by two (i.e. $H_{T}/2$). $t\bar{t}H$ and $tWH$ samples are generated using the five-flavor scheme, while the four-flavor scheme is used for the $tHjb$ process. The Standard Model cross-sections for all process are normalized to those given in the CERN Higgs Yellow Report 4 \ref{cite:yellowreport}, in which fixed scales and the five-flavour scheme are used. Those cross-sections are calculated at NLO QCD accuracy (without electroweak correction) for the $tHjb$ and $tWH$ processes, while $t\bar{t}H$ is calculated at both NLO QCD and NLO Electroweak accuracies. K-factors are then computed to scale the Higgs Characterization Monte Carlo cross-sections to the Yellow Report cross-sections. The obtained K-factors are shown to be similar for different CP mixing angles; thus, the K-factors derived for the SM case can be safely used for the various samples with different $\alpha$ values.
