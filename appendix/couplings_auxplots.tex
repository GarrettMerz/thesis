\caption{Contribution of STXS truth bins to each analysis category in total event yield. The top row corresponds to the value of $S_{90}/(S_{90} + B_{90})$ in each category, where $S_{90}$ and $B_{90}$ are respectively the total number of signal (including all STXS regions) and background events expected in the smallest $m_{\gamma \gamma}$ range containing 90\% of the signal yield. Other entries correspond to the percentage contribution of a given STXS truth bin to the Higgs signal yield in each analysis category. Entries for the STXS regions targeted by each analysis category are outlined in black if this value is above 15\%. }
